# Solana Batch Token Transfer

This project is a Node.js application that allows you to transfer tokens in batches on the Solana blockchain. 
(You can use json or csv files for account address, I did not prefer that.)
## Features

- Connects to the Solana mainnet.
- Allows you to send tokens to multiple recipient addresses.
- Uses the Solana SPL token standard.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Solana wallet with some tokens available for transfer.
